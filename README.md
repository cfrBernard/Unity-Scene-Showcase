# Unity-Scene-Showcase

A showcase of **Unity scenes built in HDRP**, focusing on lighting, atmosphere, composition, and reproducible workflows.

This repository is both a **visual portfolio** and a **technical breakdown** of how each scene was built – from blockout to final polish.

## What you’ll find here

- High-quality **HDRP scenes**
- Step-by-step **visual breakdowns** of each scene
- Notes on **lighting, atmosphere, water, and composition**
- Links to the **tooling** that supports my workflow (Python / C#)

## My Tools

Much of my workflow for these scenes is supported by custom tools.

### 🐍 Python Tools

- **MaskMapWizard** – This is a simple Python interface, designed to help you create Mask Maps by combining multiple textures (such as Metallic, AO, Detail, and Smoothness) into a single RGBA image.

### 🔧 Unity / C# Tools

- **UnityTimelapse** – Simple script designed to quickly create timelapses in Unity HDRP. Ideal for presenting scenes, cinematics, or testing lighting variations without using Timeline.
